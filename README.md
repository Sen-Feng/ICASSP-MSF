# MSF demo code for the paper "Robust Qualitative Data Clustering via Learnable Metric Space Fusion"
# Datasetscs
	Ten demo datasets are located in the Data folder.
# Code information
	All codes are written in PyCharm. The functionality of each section is as follows:
	The CODE folder contains the code details of the MSF algorithm.
	The MSF file is the execution file of the entire algorithm. The Metric_func file is the file for metric weight and metric fusion. The Weight file is a file that measures metric performance and assigns weights. UDM, CBDM, and EBDM are the base metrics we use. The Other_duc file contains some algorithms such as initialization and Adam algorithm. The information of the last ten data sets is placed in the datasets file.
# How to run
	Just add all files to the run path, and run the MSF.py file, the results will be seen in the command line window.
# Please cite the paper if the codes are helpful for your research. Citation information is provided below for the convenience of readers.
