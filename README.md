# MSF demo code for the paper "Robust Qualitative Data Clustering via Learnable Metric Space Fusion"
# Datasetscs
	Ten demo datasets are located in the CODE/datasets folder.
# Code information
	All codes are written in PyCharm. The functionality of each section is as follows:
	The CODE folder contains the code details of the MSF algorithm.
	The MSF file is the execution file of the entire algorithm. The Metric_func file is the file for metric weight and metric fusion. The Weight file is a file that measures metric performance and assigns weights. UDM, CBDM, and EBDM are the base metrics we use. The Other_duc file contains some algorithms such as initialization and Adam algorithm. The information of the last ten data sets is placed in the datasets file.
# How to run
	Just add all files to the run path and change the location where you call your dataset, then run the MSF.py file and the results will appear in the command line window.
